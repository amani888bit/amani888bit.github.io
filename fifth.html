                    <li>Q: Experience in the I.T. world?</li>
                    <p>A: In my junior and senior year of high school, I got in to the I.T. career tech class that
                        my school
                        offered. Through that class, I was also chosen to do an internship at my school for
                        repairing
                        chromebooks with another one of my classmates. I have gained both hardware and software
                        knowledge
                        through those experiences.</p>
                    <li>Q: Favorite pastime activity?</li>
                    <p>A: My favorite activity recently has been video games, mainly FPS or survival games such as
                        Valorant,
                        Stardew Valley, Raft, and Minecraft.</p>
                    <li>Q: Go to snack?</li>
                    <p>A: Any form of nuts or trail mix. Especially when I need to focus or study, both are really
                        good for the
                        brain.</p>

                <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
                <p>Nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, which help boost brain
                    function and memory.</p>
