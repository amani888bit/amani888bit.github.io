    <h2>Who I am as a Person</h2>
    <p>I'm an honest person who's always open to learning new things and applying them in real-world
        situations. I enjoy challenging myself and finding new ways to grow, both personally and professionally. I take
        pride in
        being open-minded and curious, always ready to take on new challenges and learning from them along the way. I'm
        eager to continue building new skills and contributing to a team that values effort, honesty, and growth.
        Whether its taking on new responsibilities or learning from others' experiences, I'm eager to do my best and
        keep
        improving.</p>
    <p>As a kid, I've experienced many different environment, from moving countries, schools, neighborhoods, and work
        settings. Through these experiences, it has made me adaptable
        and it has ended up being one of my strengths. I can easily adjust to new environments and situations, which has
        helped me build strong relationships with people from diverse backgrounds. I believe that being adaptable is a
        valuable
        trait to have as its taught me to adjust quickly, stay open-minded, and staying calm in unfamiliar situations.
        I've learned
        to see change as an opportunity rather than a setback, and it's helped me develop strong problem-solving and
        critical thinking skills.
        Because of that, I'm confident stepping into new roles or learning new systems and tools on the spot. I've grown
        comfortable balancing flexibility
        with responsibility, which helps me thrive in different environments.</p>
    <p>Dependability is one of the most important qualities I bring to any workplace. I believe that being reliable
        builds trust, strengthens teamwork, and helps everything run more smoothly. Whether it’s meeting deadlines,
        following through on commitments, or showing up ready to contribute, I make sure others can count on me to do my
        part. I understand that even small actions; staying organized or communicating clearly can make a big
        difference in how a team functions. No matter the task, I approach it with consistency and accountability,
        because I know dependability is what keeps a team strong and successful.</p>

    <h2>My experience:</h2>
    <p>Being selected for a Chromebook repair internship out of multiple applicants when only two positions were
        available was a rewarding experience that I’m really proud of. From the start, I've enjoyed the hands-on work
        and the challenge of diagnosing and fixing different computer issues. The internship not only helped me
        strengthen my technical skills, but it also taught me patience, attention to detail, and the importance of
        problem-solving under a time crunch. Working closely with other technicians and handling real devices gave me a
        better understanding of how computers function and how small mistakes can impact performance. Most importantly,
        it helped me learn more about myself how much I enjoy working with technology, building connections with
        coworkers, learning through experience, and improving my skills in a professional environment.</p>
